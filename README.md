# Hello-World
I am Sgt.Hixstar,
 I'm new to the coding world , I am in the process of becoming a game designer .... or so I hope. Currently, I have little to no knowledge, just getting my feet wet trying to prepare myself for school and get ahead start. I want to try and learn some relative ideas/concepts/curriculum that may help me along my studies. I have always been interested in electronics, and video games ever since I was in diapers, and that is definitely not an understatement. I recently started working on random free sites to gain relative information learning how to code and and just expanding my knowledge in anyway I can, and will accept help from anyone willing to give any kind of good advice. I've never dove this deep into the "matrix" before. Now, I have decided that it is time to take the Red pill, follow the white rabbit....
